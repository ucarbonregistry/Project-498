The project “Vaayu India Wind Power Project in Tamilnadu” in Vagaikulam, Kuruchikulam,
Ettankulam, Kalakudi, Muthammalpuram, Ukkirankottai villages in Tirunelveli district State of
Tamilnadu. The project activity involves supply, erection, commissioning and operation of 63
machines of rated capacity 800 kW each. The machines are Enercon E-53 make. The project is
owned by Vaayu India Power Corporation Pvt Ltd (hereinafter referred to as the Project Proponent
or PP).

Vaayu (India) Power Corporation Private Limited (VIPCPL) has installed 50.4 MW wind farm in
the state of Tamil Nadu in India. Wind World (India) Limited (“Wind World”) is the equipment
supplier and the operations and maintenance contractor for the Project. There are 63 Wind Energy
Convertors (“WEC’s”) of with rated capacity 800 KW each. The generated electricity is supplied to
Electricity Distribution Company (DISCOM) under a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA).
The expected operational lifetime of the project is for 20 years. The project being a renewable
energy generation activity, leads to reduction in fossil fuel dominated electricity generation from
the Indian grid.

The purpose of the project activity is to generate emission free and environment friendly electricity
from the wind energy potential available in the region. The project is expected to generate and
supply 109625.44 MWh of electricity annually to the Indian grid. The project thus addresses the
demand–supply gap in the state of Tamil Nadu and will assist the sustainable growth, conservation
of resources and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable energy source like
wind energy. The project activity will contribute towards reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emission from the atmosphere, which has been estimated to be approximately 87,689 tCO2e per
year, by displacing an equivalent amount of electricity generation through the operation of existing
fuel mix in the grid comprising mainly of fossil fuel-based power plants. Thus, the project does not
only reduce the demand-supply gap of the respective grid, but also helps in reducing other
pollutants like SOx, NOx, etc. from the atmosphere. In the absence of the project activity the
equivalent amount of electricity would have been generated from the connected/ new power plants
in the Indian grid, which are/ will be predominantly based on fossil fuels.
